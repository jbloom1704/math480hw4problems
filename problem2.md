Math 490 hw Problem 2
==================

Following are the histograms of all primes utpo 10^7 moded with n. 

We have four cases where n = 5,15,23,38 respectively

### N = 5

![5](5.png)

### N = 15

![15](15.png)

### N = 23

![23](23.png)

### N = 38
	
![38](38.png)

From the above histograms, we can see that values obtained after moding any prime with N  have nearly equal frequencies for primes
upto 10^7. 

This means that there exists a set P = {\\[  P_1\\], \\[  P_2\\], \\[  P_3\\], \\[  P_4\\],....,\\[  P_M\\]}  where each
\\[  P_i\\] is a set of primes, such that all elements in this set when moded with N yield the same number.

We can also conclude that conversely, for any N there exists the a set P as descirbes above, such that every
\\[  P_i\\] in P contains an infinitely many primes which are congruent to a \\[  p_i\\] mod N.
