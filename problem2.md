Math 490 hw Problem 2
==================

Following are the histograms of all primes utpo 10^7 moded with n. 

We have four cases where n = 5,15,23,38 respectively

### N = 5

![5](5.png)

### N = 15

![15](15.png)

### N = 23

![23](23.png)

### N = 38
	
![38](38.png)
			
****

From the above histograms, we can see that values obtained after moding any prime with N  have nearly equal frequencies for primes
upto 10^7. 

This means that there exists a set ![Set Equation](setequation.png)  where each
![P_i](pi.png) is a set of primes, such that all elements in this set when moded with N yield the same remainder.

We can also conclude that conversely, for any N there exists a set P as descirbes above, where
![P_i](pi.png) in P contains infinitely many primes such that all primes in ![P_i](pi.png)
when moded with N yield the same number. 

Hence, there are infinitely many primes that make up infinitely many subsets of the type ![P_i](pi.png)
representing the congruency of all ![Small P_i](smallpi.png) in ![P_i](pi.png) when any ![Small P_i](smallpi.png)
is moded with N
